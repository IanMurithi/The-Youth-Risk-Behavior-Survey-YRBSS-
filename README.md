# The-Youth-Risk-Behavior-Survey-YRBSS-
The Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBSS) is a national survey monitoring health behavior among youth and young adults. It is administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Use the "Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System Dataset" provided to practice calculating and interpreting the t-test. Refer to the instructional videos in the topic Resources and the Using and Interpreting Statistics: A Practical Text for the Behavioral, Social, and Health Sciences textbook as a guide.

Part 1

Refer to the topic Resources to review the documentation, questionnaires, and general information pertaining to the YRBS. Then use the 2019 "Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System Dataset" and conduct a two-sample t-test to determine if weight (in kg) differs by sex.

Part 2

Create an 8-10-slide PowerPoint presentation to discuss the findings for either the chi-square or correlation. 

Include the following:

Explain why the t-test you chose is most appropriate for analyzing the data and whether the assumptions were met.
What are the null and alternative hypotheses for this scenario?
What is the critical value? What is the decision rule?
Per the output, what is the test statistic and p-value?
Interpretation of the t-test results (What was done? What was found? What does it mean? What suggestions are there for the creation of a health promotion intervention?).
